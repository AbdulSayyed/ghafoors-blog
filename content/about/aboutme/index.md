## About Me

Hello, I'm Abdul Sayyed and welcome you to my website. Here's a bit about me and what you can expect to find here.

### Background

I'm based in London, UK, and I have a passion for learning and exploring various subjects in the world of science. My interests span a wide spectrum, including software engineering neuro science and computing. I'm particularly excited about diving into the world of machine learning to create models that can benefit different businesses and advance artificial intelligence. Coding is a major part of my life, and I love developing hybrid apps for both mobile and desktop platforms using the Hugo static site generator. My primary goal is to share what I learn on my static website.

### Current Focus

At the moment, I'm dedicated to working on machine learning and data science using Python and Jupyter notebooks. I'm exploring the endless possibilities of data and the insights it can provide. You'll find some of my coding projects and findings here.

### Beyond Science and Technology

Apart from my scientific interests, I'm deeply fascinated by the realm of spirituality. I enjoy delving into the intricacies of human existence and how various religions utilize spirituality to influence individuals. It's a journey of understanding how we're constructed and how belief systems shape our lives.

### Get in Touch

I believe that knowledge grows when it's shared and discussed. If you have any questions or insights, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:neuro.sayyed@gmail.com).

Thank you for visiting the website, and I hope you find the content here both informative and inspiring.
