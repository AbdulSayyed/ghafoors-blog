## The Early Web

In the early 1990s, when the World Wide Web was first introduced, web pages were entirely static. There was no animation, no interactivity—just text and images with basic styling. This led developers to imagine ways for users to interact directly with web pages and receive instant responses to actions, without relying on server requests for every interaction.

The goal became to create a programming solution that allowed the browser to handle tasks locally, enhancing speed and interactivity.

### Web Browsers

Two browsers dominated the early web era: Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. Netscape, eager to innovate, introduced a programming language called **LiveScript** to enable basic web interactivity. LiveScript was interpreted by the browser directly, without needing a plug-in or compilation. This marked a major step toward modern web interactivity.

Around the same time, the Java programming language introduced **applets**, small applications embedded in web pages, which required a plug-in to run. Unlike LiveScript, these applets could provide desktop-like interactions within the browser.

### LiveScript to JavaScript: A Quick but Controversial Rebranding

Although LiveScript had little in common with Java, Netscape chose to rename it **JavaScript** in a marketing move to capitalize on Java’s popularity. This led to the ongoing misconception that JavaScript and Java are closely related, although they serve very different purposes and are distinct languages.

### Microsoft's Response: JScript

In response to JavaScript’s popularity, Microsoft introduced **VBScript**, a scripting language based on BASIC, followed by **JScript**, a JavaScript alternative compatible with Internet Explorer. JScript was Microsoft's attempt to compete with JavaScript while adhering to similar standards.

### Microsoft and TypeScript: A Strategic Move

The latest major release, ECMAScript 6 (ES6), was published in 2015, introducing significant new features like classes, block scope, and modules. Microsoft’s **TypeScript** language provides ES6 compatibility and is especially useful for developers familiar with C# or Java. TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, allowing developers to write code in a structured, object-oriented manner that JavaScript engines can understand.

## JavaScript in Host Environments

JavaScript is unique in that it requires a **host environment**—a program that provides all the facilities JavaScript needs to operate. Today, web browsers serve as the most common host environment, but JavaScript is also widely used on servers with **Node.js**. Not all browsers or environments support every feature in every ECMAScript version, so compatibility can vary. To check compatibility, see [this guide](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

### JavaScript Engines

JavaScript engines are the programs that interpret and execute JavaScript code. These engines are optimized to perform JavaScript functions efficiently within the host environment.

The earliest engine, **SpiderMonkey**, was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape for Netscape Navigator and written in C++. **Rhino**, another early engine, was implemented in Java by Norris Boyd. **V8**, Google’s high-performance JavaScript engine, is widely used today and powers both Google Chrome and Node.js, with support for many ES6 features. Apple’s **JavaScriptCore**, also known as WebKit, is another popular engine found in Safari.

This list is only a brief overview of JavaScript’s evolution. With technology advancing rapidly, JavaScript will continue evolving, likely remaining the "assembly language of the web" for years to come.

## Standardization and ECMAScript

In 1996, JavaScript was submitted to the international standards organization ECMA, where it was formalized as **ECMAScript**. Although the language we know as JavaScript is based on ECMAScript specifications, JavaScript remains the widely recognized and colloquial name. ECMA doesn’t develop code; instead, it defines specifications that implementers follow to create JavaScript engines.

The first standardized edition, **ECMA-262**, was published in June 1997. Subsequent editions include:

- **ECMA-262 1st Edition**: 1997
- **ECMA-262 2nd Edition**: 1998
- **ECMA-262 3rd Edition**: 1999
- **ECMA-262 5th Edition**: 2009
- **ECMA-262 5.1 Edition**: 2011
- **ECMA-262 6th Edition (ES6/ES2015)**: 2015
- **ECMA-262 7th Editions Post-ES6**: 2016
- **ECMA-262 8th Editions**: 2017
- **ECMA-262 9th Editions**: 2018
- **ECMA-262 10th Editions**: 2019
- **ECMA-262 11th Editions**: 2020
- **ECMA-262 12th Editions**: 2021
- **ECMA-262 13th Editions**: 2021

### Major Milestone: ECMAScript 3

One of JavaScript’s most significant updates came with **ECMAScript 3** in 1999, which introduced essential features like nested functions, regular expressions, and switch statements. According to Brendan Eich, JavaScript’s creator, this update was pivotal, introducing many features we now take for granted.

Notably, **ECMAScript 4** was never officially released due to conflicting opinions among developers. ECMAScript 5 later introduced **strict mode**, which made JavaScript safer and more predictable.

#### Key Features in ES6

ECMAScript 6 (2015) introduced several awaited features, including:

- **`const`**: for immutable variables
- **`let`**: for block-scoped variables
- **Arrow functions (`=>`)**: for cleaner syntax and lexical `this`
- **Classes**: for an easier syntax for object-oriented programming
- **Symbols**: for unique, unchangeable properties useful in debugging
- **Generators**: for creating iterators and handling asynchronous tasks
- **Typed Arrays**: for handling binary data, useful in multimedia processing

## Notable Feature of Other Editions

### JavaScript Beyond ES6 7th Edition

- Exponentiation operator (**): Simplifies exponent calculations, e.g., 2 ** 3 (instead of Math.pow(2, 3)).
- Array.prototype.includes(): A method to check if an array includes a particular element, improving readability.

### JavaScript 8th Edition

- async/await: Simplifies asynchronous code and handling promises.
- Object.values() and Object.entries(): Makes it easier to work with object properties.
- String padding (padStart and padEnd): Adds padding to strings to a specified length.
- SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics: Enables low-level memory manipulation, crucial for multi-threaded operations in JavaScript.

### JavaScript 9th Edition

- Rest/Spread properties for objects: Expands rest (...rest) and spread syntax (...spread) usage in objects.
- Asynchronous Iteration: Introduces the for await...of loop for async operations.
- Promise.finally(): Allows cleanup actions after a promise settles.
- Regular Expression Enhancements: Adds s (dotAll) flag, Unicode property escapes, and lookbehind assertions for RegExp.

### JavaScript 10th Edition

- Array.flat() and Array.flatMap(): Flattens nested arrays and maps while flattening.
- Object.fromEntries(): Converts key-value pairs (from Map or arrays) into an object.
- String.trimStart() and String.trimEnd(): Removes whitespace from the start or end of strings.
- Optional catch binding: Allows omitting the catch parameter if not needed in error handling.

### JavaScript 11th Edition

- Optional Chaining (?.): Safely accesses deeply nested properties.
- BigInt: A new primitive data type for representing integers larger than the Number type can hold.
