## Legacy Code Modernization with Generative AI

Legacy code refers to the existing codebase that has been developed over time and may be outdated or difficult to maintain. It is often characterized by outdated programming languages, lack of documentation, poor software architecture, and dependencies on obsolete technologies. Managing and modernizing legacy code poses several challenges, including limited scalability, reduced maintainability, and a higher risk of bugs and security vulnerabilities.

To address these challenges, organizations are increasingly turning to Generative AI techniques to automate various tasks involved in managing and modernizing legacy code. Generative AI models can analyze the structure and patterns in legacy code to suggest refactoring improvements, generate documentation, identify bugs, and propose fixes, and assist in migrating code to modern platforms or languages.

## Challenges of Managing Legacy Code

Legacy code poses several challenges for organizations, including:

- **Outdated programming languages**: Legacy code is often written in outdated programming languages that may no longer be supported or optimized for modern development practices. This makes it difficult to integrate legacy code with new technologies or platforms, limiting the scalability and flexibility of the codebase.
- **Lack of documentation**: Legacy code is typically poorly documented, making it challenging for developers to understand and maintain.

## The Role of Generative AI

Generative AI uses machine learning algorithms to generate new content like code, text, or images. When applied to legacy code, Generative AI techniques help to automate various tasks involved in managing and modernizing the existing codebase.

### Examples

- **Code refactoring**: Generative AI models can analyze the structure and patterns in legacy code to suggest refactoring improvements. They automatically identify redundant code blocks, optimize algorithms, or propose alternative coding styles that align with modern best practices. This helps enhance code readability, reduce technical debt, and improve overall software quality. For example, tools like DeepCode can identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities in the code, enabling developers to fix them more efficiently.
- **Document generation**: Generative AI models can analyze the codebase and automatically generate documentation, including function descriptions, API references, and usage examples. This saves developers valuable time and effort in manually documenting the codebase, making it easier for new team members to understand and work with the existing code. For instance, tools like NaturalDocs can generate comprehensive documentation from comments, variables, and function signatures, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the legacy code.
- **Bug detection and resolution**: Legacy code often contains hidden bugs that may go unnoticed for a long time. Generative AI models can analyze code patterns and identify potential bug-prone areas. By flagging potential issues early on, developers can proactively address them before they escalate into critical problems. Moreover, Generative AI can also suggest fixes or patches for identified bugs based on patterns observed in similar scenarios. For instance, tools like "DeepCode" can generate code snippets or entire functions based on the context of the legacy code, saving developers valuable time and effort.
- **Migration to modern technologies**: Legacy systems often rely on outdated technologies that are no longer supported or efficient. Generative AI can assist in migrating legacy code to modern platforms or languages by automatically translating the codebase into the desired target technology. This significantly reduces the manual effort required for rewriting the entire codebase from scratch. For example, tools like "Kite" use machine learning algorithms to suggest relevant code snippets, function calls, and variable names, enhancing developer productivity while working with legacy code.

## IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z

Over 80% of in-person transactions at U.S. financial institutions use COBOL. IBM has identified:

- 240 billion lines of COBOL code running today
- An additional 5 billion lines being written every year

### Key Insights from IBM Institute for Business Value Research

- Organizations are more likely to leverage existing mainframe assets rather than rebuild their application estates from scratch in the next two years.
- A lack of resources and skills remains the top challenge for these organizations.

### Approaches to Application Modernization

- **Rewriting all application code in Java**: May sacrifice core capabilities of IBM Z and fail to deliver expected cost reductions.
- **Migrating everything to the public cloud**: Similar drawbacks as rewriting in Java.

### Challenges with Current Tools

- Tools that convert COBOL applications to Java syntax can produce code that is difficult to maintain and unfamiliar to Java developers.
- Current AI-assisted partial re-write technology lacks COBOL support and does not optimize the resulting Java code for specific tasks.

### Introducing IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z

IBM has launched watsonx Code Assistant for Z, a new product that utilizes generative AI to:

- Facilitate the translation of COBOL to Java
- Enhance developer productivity on the platform

### Features of watsonx Code Assistant for Z

- Part of the watsonx code assistant product family
- Powered by IBM's watsonx.ai code model, which:
  - Knows 115 coding languages
  - Learned from 1.5 trillion tokens
  - Has 20 billion parameters, making it one of the largest generative AI models for code automation

### Future Expansion

- The watsonx Code Assistant product portfolio will expand over time to cover other programming languages.
- Aims to address the challenges faced by developers and improve the time to value for modernization efforts.

### Benefits of Using watsonx Code Assistant for Z

- Assists businesses in leveraging generative AI and automated tools to expedite the modernization of their mainframe applications.
- Preserves the performance, security, and resilience capabilities of IBM Z.
- Allows developers to selectively and incrementally transform COBOL business services into well-structured, high-quality Java code.
- Enables efficient modernization of large applications, allowing developers to focus on higher-impact tasks.

By using watsonx Code Assistant for Z on a large scale, developers can quickly assess, update, validate, and test the appropriate code, making the modernization process more efficient.

### Key steps in the journey include

- Refactoring business services in COBOL
- Transforming COBOL code into optimized Java code
- Validating the outcome through automated testing

### The potential benefits for clients include

- Accelerated code development and increased developer productivity throughout the application modernization lifecycle
- Managed cost, complexity, and risk associated with modernization initiatives, including translation and code optimization
- Expanded access to a wider pool of IT skills and faster developer onboarding
- Improved quality, easily maintainable code through model customization and best practices application

The resulting Java code from watsonx Code Assistant for Z will be object-oriented and optimized for interoperability with the rest of the COBOL application, including CICS, IMS, DB2, and other z/OS runtimes. Java on Z is designed to deliver performance optimization compared to x86 platforms.
