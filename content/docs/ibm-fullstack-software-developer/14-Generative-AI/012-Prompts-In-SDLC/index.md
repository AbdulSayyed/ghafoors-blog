Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models. It involves crafting questions or statements that guide the model to produce accurate and relevant responses. By iterating on prompt design, developers can improve the quality of outputs, making AI tools more useful for specific tasks in software design and development.

## Software Design Prompts

- Following are two prompts similar in meaning and usage but uses different styles.

1. Design a modernization plan for a legacy monolithic application to transition to a microservices architecture. Include considerations for scalability, resilience, and seamless deployment processes.

2. Develop a plan to modernize an outdated monolithic application by transitioning it to a microservices architecture. Ensure the plan addresses scalability, resilience, and smooth deployment processes.

- **More prompts**

- Propose an architecture for a high-traffic social media application that can handle millions of concurrent users. Outline the database, server, and caching strategies that will ensure optimal performance.

- Generate a secure software architecture for an online trading system. Highlight how you would incorporate encryption, authentication, and audit logging to safeguard user transactions and data privacy.

- Create a blueprint for a cloud-native SaaS application tailored for the healthcare industry.
  Discuss how to utilize cloud services for compliance with health data regulations, data analytics,
  and interoperability with other systems.

- Draft an IoT-enabled smart home system architecture. Explain how various smart devices will
  communicate with each other and the cloud, ensuring low latency and high data throughput,
  while maintaining user privacy

### Coding Prompts

- I'm in the process of developing a JavaScript web application and need guidance on implementing a secure login function that utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Please include comments within the code for clarity.

- I have a dataset in CSV format that holds sales data from the past year. Using R, could you script an analysis to predict next month's sales? Provide a step-by-step explanation of the approach.

- I'm developing a mobile app using Flutter. Can you assist me in writing Dart code for a custom animated splash screen that aligns with my app's theme and smoothly transitions to the homepage?

- Please help me construct a SQL query to retrieve all records from a 'users' table where the 'last_login' is older than six months and elaborate on how indexes could optimize this query for a large database.

- "I'm getting a 'SyntaxError: invalid syntax' in my Python code. Can you help me figure out what's causing it?"

- "My Python script is giving me an 'IndexError: list index out of range'. What could be the issue here?"

- "I'm encountering a 'NameError: name 'some_variable' is not defined' in my Python code. How can I address this?"

- "My Python program is throwing a 'KeyError' when working with dictionaries. Any suggestions on how to fix this?"

- "I'm seeing a 'TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str' while working with variables in Python. How can I resolve this?"

## Prompt Engineering Exercise

1. **Task**: Design a prompt for a Generative AI model to generate a software architecture diagram for an e-commerce platform. The diagram should illustrate the components, interactions, and data flows of the system.
2. Provide a comprehensive and detailed step-by-step solution to the coding problems in the Python programming language.
