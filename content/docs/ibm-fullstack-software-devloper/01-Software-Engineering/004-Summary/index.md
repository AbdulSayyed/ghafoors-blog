### What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?

{{< bs/alert info >}}

- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) helps improve efficiency and reduce risks by:
    - Defining tasks and timelines for team members.
    - Facilitating communication between customers, stakeholders, and development teams.
    - Clarifying the roles of stakeholders in the process.
    - Ensuring cross-domain teams are aware when their tasks are complete so the development can proceed to the next phase.

### What does SRS documents do?

{{< bs/alert info >}}

- The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the functionalities that the software must perform and defines benchmarks or service levels for its performance.

{{< /bs/alert >}}

---

### What is URS?

{{< bs/alert info >}}

- The User Requirements Specification (URS) is a subset of the SRS and focuses on detailing user-specific requirements.

{{< /bs/alert >}}

---

### What does (SysRs) contain?

{{< bs/alert info >}}

- The System Requirements Specification (SysRS) contains the information found in the SRS, along with additional details such as system capabilities, interfaces, user characteristics, policy and regulatory requirements, performance criteria, security considerations, and system acceptance criteria.

### What are different methodologies for implementing the SDLC?

{{< bs/alert info >}}

- There are various methodologies for implementing the SDLC, including Waterfall, V-shape model, and Agile.

---

### How functional and non functional testing differ?

{{< bs/alert info >}}

- Functional testing checks the inputs and expected outputs of the system, whereas non-functional testing examines attributes like performance, security, scalability, and availability. Regression testing ensures that recent changes, such as bug fixes, don't negatively affect existing functionality.

### What are different type of documentation?

{{< bs/alert info >}}

- Types of documentation include:
    - Requirements documentation
    - Design documentation
    - Technical documentation
    - Quality assurance documentation
    - User documentation
