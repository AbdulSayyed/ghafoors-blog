## Welcome to this course

Explore the aspects of generative AI for software development. 

If you're a software developer, your work likely involves a lot of coding or coding reviews. You would probably agree that a little help to write or generate codes and detect bugs would make the process easier. This is just the beginning of what generative AI can do for your software development activities. 

Since the release of ChatGPT, AI has been all over the headlines. A recent research conducted by Mackenzie found that generative AI or genAI features tend to add up to $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually. Generative AI impacts almost all areas. From writing resumes to generating and debugging complex code just by using a few prompts. You can save time and effort, thereby increasing software development efficiency. 

To learn how you can do just that and more, explore this course that walks you through the many capabilities and use cases of generative AI for software development. 

The course is divided into three modules that teach you to leverage generative AI tools for software development. This course is a combination of videos, readings, and practice quizzes. Additionally, you will have plenty of demo videos and labs to help perform these in your daily tasks and a cheat sheet to help you lock in the information when needed. You will also create a learning platform using AI on your own as a hands-on final project. 

So if you're a software developer, web developer, mobile developer, front end developer, back end developer, DevOps professional, or just a software engineer looking to leverage AI to become more efficient and productive, this course is for you. You can also take this course if you're learning to be a software developer.

## Course Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you must understand software developer processes and have knowledge of programming languages. Additionally, you will need a running computer with a modern web browser and a reliable Internet connection.

### Module 1

Learn how to use genAI in the software development life cycle. You will get an understanding of AI algorithms such as large language models and natural language processing and explore the use of AI for technical help with coding and use it to generate a static website.

### Module 2

Use generative AI for CI/CD and DevSecOps. You will generate architectural diagrams, leverage AI for software testing and software workflows, and explore the ethical considerations of using AI for software development.

### Module 3

Build a complete learning platform, leveraging all AI tools and prompts for the final project. This will enable you to apply the knowledge you acquired throughout this course.

## Course Tips
