### AI and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science dedicated to creating intelligent machines capable of thinking, learning, and solving problems in ways similar to humans. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, involves developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning (DL), a further subset of ML, employs artificial neural networks to tackle and solve complex problems.
