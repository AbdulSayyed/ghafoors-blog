- Familiarity with the Jupyter Notebook environment
- Understanding of Statistics, Probability, Calculus and Linear Algebra

## AI and Machine Learning (2)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science dedicated to creating intelligent machines capable of thinking, learning, and solving problems in ways similar to humans. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, involves developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning (DL), a further subset of ML, employs artificial neural networks to tackle and solve complex problems.

### History of AI

The journey to this new era of AI has been marked by many ups and downs. The historical rise and fall of investments and excitement around AI has led to the current AI boom. Today's advancements show significant progress compared to those of the past.

### Real-World Applications

Real-world applications of AI demonstrate the underlying principles that make these technologies possible. Two significant breakthroughs in AI are image processing and machine translation.

### Image Processing

Image classification involves tasks such as identifying pictures of dogs and cats. By 2015, computers achieved better classification accuracy than humans.

### Machine Translation

Machine translation involves translating phrases between languages, considering word order and proper phrasing. Current machine translation systems achieve near-human performance.

### Challenges and Advancements

Classical ML models faced difficulties in identifying useful features in images and handling the complexities of natural language processing. Advancements in deep learning, along with innovations in data storage and processing power, have enabled overcoming these barriers.

### Impact of AI

The impact of AI is vast and comparable to the impact of electricity a hundred years ago, as noted by AI leader Andrew Ng[^1]. AI affects various industries, including advertising, retail (with supply chain optimization), transportation (with self-driving cars), and smart homes (providing voice command entertainment and security).

### Definitions

**Artificial Intelligence**: Any program that can sense, reason, act, and adapt. Essentially, a machine exhibiting intelligent behavior.

**Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that replicates intelligent behaviour and learns from exposure to more data.

**Deep Learning**: A subset of ML involving algorithms with multi-layered neural networks, improving with more data exposure.

### Further Exploration

Merriam-Webster defines AI as a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers. Wikipedia takes it further, describing AI as mimicking cognitive functions like learning and problem-solving. AI discussions often center around human-like intelligence, which ties to the historical coining of the term and the Turing question. Examples of AI not falling under ML or deep learning include rule-based systems that do not learn from new data.

The next section explores machine learning and deep learning in more detail, examining their specific meanings and applications.
