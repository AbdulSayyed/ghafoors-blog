- title: What are the key tools that support modern application workflows?
  content: |
    The key tools that support modern application workflows are version control systems, libraries, frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, build tools, packages, and package managers.

- title: What is the purpose of version control systems in application development?
  content: |
    Version control systems are indispensable for managing code changes, especially when multiple developers collaborate on a project. They track who made changes, what was altered, and when, resolving conflicts between contributions as they arise.

- title: Can you provide examples of popular version control tools?
  content: |
    - **Git**: A widely-used distributed version control system.
    - **GitHub**: A platform for hosting and managing Git repositories.

- title: What are libraries and how do they benefit application development?
  content: |
    Libraries are pre-written collections of code that provide functionality you can integrate directly into your application. They simplify development by reducing the need to write code from scratch for common tasks, enabling faster and more efficient app creation.

- title: What are the styles of pair programming?
  content: |
    - **Driver/Navigator Style**: One developer writes the code while the navigator reviews it in real-time, offering guidance and feedback.
    - **Ping-Pong Style**: Incorporates test-driven development; one developer writes a failing test, and the second writes the code to pass it, alternating roles.
    - **Strong Style**: The more experienced developer guides implementation while the other learns and observes.

- title: What are the benefits of pair programming?
  content: |
    Pair programming offers several advantages:
    - **Knowledge Sharing**: Developers exchange knowledge, valuable for onboarding new team members.
    - **Skill Development**: Enhances both technical expertise and communication skills through active collaboration.
    - **Improved Code Quality**: Results in fewer mistakes thanks to real-time feedback and review.
    - **Increased Efficiency**: Produces better code upfront, reducing time spent on reviews, testing, and debugging later.
