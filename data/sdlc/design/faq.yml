- title: What is the purpose of the Design phase in SDLC?
  content: The purpose of the Design phase is to convert requirements into a blueprint for the softwareâ€™s structure and functionality.

- title: What activities are involved in the Design phase?
  content: Activities in the Design phase include Architectural Design, Prototype Development, and Design Document Creation.

    The primary activities in the Design Phase of Software Development include Architectural Design, Prototype Development, and Design Document Creation.

- title: What is Architectural Design in the Design Phase?
  content: |
    Architectural Design focuses on defining the high-level structure and organization of the software system. It acts as a foundation for all subsequent development activities.
    - **Purpose**: To outline the system's overall framework, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
    - **Key Tasks**:
      - Defining system components and their relationships.
      - Establishing data flow and interaction between components.
      - Selecting the technology stack (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, and tools).
      - Designing system layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data storage.
      - Addressing non-functional aspects like performance, security, and fault tolerance.
    - **Outcome**: A clear system architecture that ensures a solid foundation for development and testing.

- title: What is Prototype Development in the Design Phase?
  content: |
    Prototype Development involves creating a working model of the system or its key components to validate ideas and gather feedback early in the design process.
    - **Purpose**: To visualize and refine system requirements, user interfaces, and interactions before full-scale development.
    - **Key Tasks**:
      - Developing low-fidelity prototypes (e.g., sketches or wireframes) for basic structure and navigation.
      - Building high-fidelity prototypes with functional features to simulate real-world interactions.
      - Testing prototypes with stakeholders to validate usability, design choices, and requirements.
    - **Benefits**:
      - Identifies potential issues early, reducing costly revisions later.
      - Enhances communication between developers, designers, and stakeholders.
      - Provides a tangible model for refining user experience (UX).

- title: What is Design Document Creation in the Design Phase?
  content: |
    Design Document Creation serves as the detailed blueprint that guides developers and stakeholders throughout the development process.
    - **Purpose**: To document all design-related decisions, ensuring clarity and consistency.
    - **Key Components**:
      - System Architecture Diagrams: Visual representations of components and their interactions.
      - Module Specifications: Detailed descriptions of each component, its behavior, and interfaces.
      - Data Models: Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) or schemas to define how data will be organized.
      - UI/UX Design Specifications: Mockups and guidelines for user interfaces.
      - API Specifications: Descriptions of application programming interfaces (APIs) for system integration.
    - **Outcome**: A comprehensive document that developers can follow to implement the system as designed.



- title: What are the phases of software release?
  content: The phases of software release include Alpha Release, Beta Release, and GA (General Availability) Release.

- title: What is the difference between an Alpha and Beta release?
  content: The Alpha release is the first functioning version given to a select group of stakeholders, likely containing errors. The Beta release is given to stakeholders outside the developing organization to test functionality and identify bugs, meeting all functional requirements.
