    - **System Requirements Specification (SysRS) Document**: Describes the technical requirements and constraints of the system, such as hardware and software configurations.

- title: Describe Requirements Gathering in Planning Phase?
  content: |
    - Requirements Gathering is the process of identifying, documenting, and understanding the needs and expectations of stakeholders. It ensures that the project goals are clear and aligned with business objectives.
    - This involves collecting and documenting the software's necessary requirements, which are detailed in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS). The SRS may include use cases that describe business needs and user workflows. Requirements are classified into four categories:
      - Functional Requirements: Specify what the software should do.
      - Non-Functional Requirements: Specify how the software should perform.
      - Business Requirements: Define the business goals the software should achieve.
      - Stakeholder Requirements: Represent the needs of different stakeholders involved in the project.

- title: What are Functional Requirements?
  content: |
    Functional Requirements focus on the specific features and functionalities the software must provide to meet user needs or business objectives.

- title: What is the purpose of Functional Requirements?
  content: |
    The purpose of Functional Requirements is to define what the software should do.

- title: Provide examples of Functional Requirements?
  content: |
    - A user should be able to log in using their username and password.
    - The system must generate a monthly report of sales.
    - The application should support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.

- title: What is the nature of Functional Requirements?
  content: |
    Functional Requirements are descriptive and directly related to the user's tasks or goals.

- title: What are Non-Functional Requirements?
  content: |
    Non-Functional Requirements focus on the quality attributes of the system, detailing the operational aspects and constraints under which the functional requirements must operate.

- title: What is the purpose of Non-Functional Requirements?
  content: |
    The purpose of Non-Functional Requirements is to define how the software performs its functions.
