### How to use images

- They are kept in `/static/images/` folders.
- The names must be in lowercase, separated by hypen. Kee the name short but descriptive.
- To put the border around them and emborse or embec copy right messages use the file `imagify.py` preesnt in `images` folder. you need to be in this folder to run the command.
- The command input is `python imagify.py stats/basic/<filename.png>`. It will create the process file with the same name in the `output` folder underneath.
- Three types of images can be used `.png, jpeg, .webp`. If you only give the folder name it will apply the formatting to all files present it the folder.
- Make sure the `output` is empty before you use it.
- Also use some platfrom and regenerate the images to make it different from what you have if they are not original or give credit to the original creator.
- Try using common sense.
